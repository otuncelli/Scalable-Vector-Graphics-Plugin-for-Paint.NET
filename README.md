SvgFileType
===========

This is a Paint.NET filetype plugin for loading SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and its compressed variant SVGZ files. 

The plugin is a tiny wrapper around the [SVG.NET Library](https://github.com/vvvv/SVG) which does the actual SVG reading.

Tested on Paint.NET 4.0.21.

Please check the [Releases](https://github.com/otuncelli/Scalable-Vector-Graphics-Plugin-for-Paint.NET/releases) section for binary download.

To install the plugin perform the following steps:
 * Put the DLL in the `<Paint.NET>\FileTypes` directory (default location is `C:\Program Files\paint.net\FileTypes`)
   * For the [Windows Store version of Paint.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBHCS1LX4R0), put the DLL in the `<Documents>\paint.net App Files\FileTypes` directory
 * Restart Paint.NET if you have it open
